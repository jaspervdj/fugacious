# fugacious

Fugacious is a sample Haskell application.

It provides users with a
[temporary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fugacious) email address
they can use to avoid giving your real email address to spammy websites.

## Motivation

Many samples of Haskell applications can be found in blogposts around the
internet.  Unfortunately, they tend to be (rightfully) handwavy about all sorts
of implementation details, like logging, database access, configuration and
deployment.

Fugacious is also an example, that I occasionally use when teaching Haskell.
However, it is also an exercise in going the other way and writing all pieces of
boilerplate and glue.  As such, it is a rather boring¹ codebase.

The codebase tries to relentlessly follow good² practices, as I've learned them
over a good amount of years.  Despite that, it is a simple codebase.  Whenever
there is a choice between patterns, I attempt to choose the simplest one that
works.

(¹) But boring in a good way, boring as in "nothing special going on".  
(²) I'm not calling this best practices since a lot of it is fairly subjective.
